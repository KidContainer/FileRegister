# FileRegister
This is a pretty small program running with a console which has no information in it.
It's more like a script which can be done with Python(I did it),but it's writen with CPP at first.

Just put the first program in a place and run it.
When it terminates, a file named 登记簿.txt will appear in the current directory and its subdirectories. In the file,it has
the names of the files in the directory and their sizes.

The second program do the opposite and delete these file created by the first program.
